# js-huggle

JS huggle (a marriage between the words for hug and snuggle) is a proof-of-concept educational platform that I am developing to ease the transition from natural (i.e. human) languages to logical (i.e. programming) languages for those making this transition for the first time.

**DEPRECATION NOTICE** I have put this project on hold after realising that the correct concept must involve a syntax analyser and a level mixer which cannot be done via the browser's console.
