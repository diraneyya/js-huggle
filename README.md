# js-huggle

JS huggle (a marriage between the words for hug and snuggle) is an emerging educational platform that I am developing to act as an _unblocker_/_unstucker_ for easing the transition from natural (i.e. human) languages to logical (i.e. programming) languages for those making this transition for the first time.

The rationale is that people with certain life adaptations might find the transition to be incredibly challenging. Those people, when lured by the job opportunities and the  lifestyle of so-called coders often end up signing up for an online course, or even enrol in a coding bootcamp, which can last anywhere between 1 and 5 months.

My experience is that those people are often not well catered to in either one fo the two cases above.

Online courses, are often based off the idea of baked projects, which follow one man's path to acquiring knowledge without taking into account possible changes in plan, and the fact that people's interest and paths to knowledge acquisition are different. Project-based learning, when based off videos and manuals, often do not promote exploration and problem solving, and hence do not lead to a true understanding of the underlying concepts of logical languages.

At best, they only lead to familiarity with the dictated type of project, which does not translate to capability and skill in the real world.

As for coding bootcamps, they often take into account that people with the exact situation above (around 30%) might face learning difficulties, due to their lack of exposure to logical languages prior to the bootcamp. Hence it is common for bootcamps to accept the fact that many of these people might not to be able to gain the skills needed by th end of the bootcamp.

This is hilarious, since those people are left out in either case, only to blame their own minds and levels of intelligence. It can be a brutal experience for some.

From the point of view of these people, coding bootcamps are generally not worth the money, and can be seen as a scam. In the best case scenario, the experience of paying lots of money and going through a coding bootcamp only to learn a minimum amount does not help with the self-esteem of the person, either.

Those people often claim that they never wanted to learn how to code in the first place, which is more often than not, a protection mechanism in order to protect the person's ego and self-esteem, should they not succeed in learning the skill.

The way I see it, is that no one would turn down the opportunity to let computers do what they would do otherwise, through manual labour, which is what logical languages enable us to do. If one said they never wanted to do that, but still put themselves through a few-month bootcamp, then I would suspect that they are not honest with themselves and others.

In my view, everyone can learn how logical languages, aka programming languages, work. And can find a great deal of fulfillment and satisfaction learning and using them.

The thing is, it really requires completely different, often even opposing adaptations of the mind to be able to learn and use logical languages, when compared to communicating using human or natural languages.

This means that the better you master the realm of human communication, the more likely you are going to be at a disadvantage when venturing into logical languages, or this is at least what I believe.

In my view, bootcamps can be a great environment for learning if you are a social learner and if you learn by doing, but they usually do not succeed in resolving the learning blockage of someone who never dealt with a programming language before. They, also, as educational service providers suffer from the poor imprints of society when it comes to learning... Touching on areas of psychological safety, childhood trauma, and many other, unwieldy and complex issues.

This is where I would like to make something in the direction of making a difference, bringing the people on Earth one step closer to being more on par with the technology that had been serving them so well.

I see no other way to do this but to enable all of humanity somehow to being adept at understanding and using these logical (i.e. programming) languages.

Unfortunately, the goal with learning logical languages is more complicated than _allowing someone to write commands in the target language_. Rather it is often to _allow someone to truly understand the logical foundation of such a medium of communication, making it incredibly effortless to switch between such languages, learn new ones, and effectively engaging in the act of contributing to technology at an (ever-increasing) quick pace_.

This is such a rabbit hole. And it goes a little deeper than most people think. I would go as far as saying that humans are having a co-evolutionary relationship with their software stacks, where software stacks are continuously evolving to address the way we have been working around such logical languages.

Namely, logical languages are becoming more permissive, closer to natural languages, for a good reason, which is our general difficulty in adapting to this realm of thinking in modern times. Hence the continuous seeking of pre-processors, introducing layers and layers of bloating and syntactical sugar.

The thing is, even with all of the above, and even after trying to make software as easy to get into with a minimal logical mindset, making reliable and good software is still not possible when the basic concepts are not well understood, and shortcuts often taken.

From my observations as a coding teacher, I noticed that a fair number of people, when attempting to learn logical languages, opt for memorization in vast areas of their learning, rather than try to re-route all of the taught syntax to the logical (and exception-free) rules of interpretation of the language.

This had created more pressure for logical languages to become less logical in their syntax, offering easier-to-understand, but necessarily superfluous syntactical options, which is what we often refer to as syntactical sugar.

However, the look for those who truly understand the logical foundation upon which logical languages are built, are more in high demand than ever. This only speaks to the scarcity of which individuals, and the dire need created by crucial technologies for ones of this caliber of individuals, which remain to be a small proportion of the population.

You might disagree with me, but I would at least say that even if you think they are not scarce, there should be much more of them, considering that the majority of what we do today is enabled by software. This is my opinion.

I think we should, as a specie, feel threatened simply by the fact that technology is becoming more and more complicated, yet the ones who understand our software stacks at a very deep level are becoming older and older, without a clear pathway to replacing them with ones who are equally involved and understand the nuances of these (mostly history-rich) layers of software.

What we really need is a complete transition in thinking, to logical thinking. This will not only serve our relationship with software (which is becoming more and more a part of us), but will also boost our ability to think creatively and tackle difficult issues that will determine our survival as a specie. 

Transitioning to logical thinking is a tremendous task that takes an incredible amount of psychological preparation. The ones who truly made the leap, made it on their own using nothing but free content and a good search engine.

Why? because your brain would not allow you to transcend to that elevated level of logical reasoning and theoretical inquiry without having all of your less-privileged needs fully met. It always helps to remember that our ancestors were occupied with things of a different nature, such as food and shelter. 

Hence, it is not until your physiological, safety, and _huggle_ (i.e. love and belonging) needs are fully met, that your biology would allow you to even indulge in that elevated pursuit (ideas and subtractions such as "generator functions" and "closures" come to mind at this point, no one hungry, triggered or unloved will dream of comprehending these ideas).

My point is that, it is very hard to let people sink into that privileged state of knowledge acquisition when they are in a corporate educational environment. Especially not when the job center is following up on them. There is not enough psychological safety under these circumstances to really melt and sink into this kind of involved learning.

People who truly make it as self-taught programmers, are 9 out of 10 ones who did it in their own beds with a cup of popcorn and a loving warm body next to them. Those are also the ones who speak vocally against coding bootcamps.

Truth is that, not everyone can unblock/unstuck themselves when learning online. Some people, mainly those _with heavy natural-language adaptations_ simply cannot.

At least this is my opinion.

But this is too long of an introduction and a README in a GitHub repo, so let me just conclude by saying this project is my humble way to contribute to society, by allowing the world to transition to logical thinking, through JS as an entry-point logical languages. 

The learning happens asynchronously (at the learner's time) via an automated agent that is always going to be there for the learner, will never get upset, and will allow everyone, regardless of their background and baggage, to sink into a wonderful state of learning a logical language, unlocking one of the biggest wonders of the human brain (which is its ability to create abstractions and to use these overcome its immediate limitations in its auditory pipeline, the main and the original carrier of human speech and natural languages).

This is my grand vision for this tool which I am not hesitant to put forward regardless of where the tool is at the moment of writing this.

If you feel that this aim had inspired you and you wish to collaborate, please reach out to me, create issues, and start discussions.

Many names come to memory as I conclude this writing. Some of the loveliest people I know, have been relentlessly trying to learn coding for many years now, without success. This effort is, in a wy, dedicated to all of them.

I intend to take this platform and use it to launch my own educational venture in June 2023.

Until then I would like to create an environment that:
1. generates levels automatically using a mixer engine
2. maintain a skills matrix that reflects the level of the user's syntactical understanding of javascript
3. levels can be generated to be mildly challenging, based on the current level of the player, applying element of timed repetition and taking time since last played and time to solve level into account
4. the game is completely asynchronous, always available, and have an encouraging and an empathetic voice
5. when the platform fails to bridge the gap between old and new skills taking into account the concept of moderately challenging the user, it asks the user for hints on what of the pre-requisite skills they think might be blocking them.
6. as a holistic agent, the game might also suggest that the user stops learning and have some time for themselves, to lower their stress level. Alternatively, a social service of connecting people who are worn out and unable to be productive with the learning or links to external resources can be provided.

What this is:
> an asynchronous platform focused on teaching logical thinking via the mastery of the **syntax of Javascript** (as a popular entry-level general-purpose logical language and a carrier of logical syntax)

What this is not:
> this might come as a surprise but it is outside the scope of this platform to teach the craft of programming, via best practices, how to name variables, how to structure code, how to do testing, etc. I could have as well created this platform using my own, invented logical language. But then, Javascript was a good option for various reasons, and hence I did it. But this is not intended as a platform to teach coding, rather, it is a pre-coding learning platform that uses the syntax of Javascript as a tool to teach **logical thinking**
